# Knob

Simple slider-like control that depicts its path as an arc using CoreAnimation layers. Supports both iOS and macOS 
platforms.

Like a slider, touch movements in the control change the value. For my implementation:

* Only vertical movements change the value. Moving up will increase the value, moving down will decrease it.
* By default, touch sensitivity is set to 1x the height of the knob -- a touch moving 1x the height would
  change the value from 0.0 to 1.0. See the documentation for the `touchSensitivity` parameter.
* Touch sensitivity can be increased by moving the touch horizontally away from the control (either direction).
  This is similar to the change in "scrubbing" speed when watching a video -- the further the touch moves away
  from the scrubber, the finer the positioning is within the video (larger movements for same amount of change in value)
* For now, this control reports value changes continuously -- there is no way to disable this as there is for
  a UISlider.

The above picture was taken from my [SoundFonts](https://github.com/bradhowes/SoundFonts) iOS app where the
knobs control various audio effects settings.

Included is a playground for playing with a knob.

## Configuration

* `minimumValue` -- the lowest value that the control will report out.
* `maximumValue` -- the highest value that the control will report out.
* `value` -- the current value of the control (settable).
* `travelDistance` -- the number of pixels to use in mouse/touch event distance calculations. By default this is the 
smaller of the frame width/height.
* `touchSensitivity` -- scaling factor between touch movement and value change. The default is `1` which means that one
must drag 1x `travelDistance` in order to change the value from `miminimumValue` to `maximumValue`; a value of `2` would
require 2x `travelDistance`.
* `maxChangeRegionWidthPercentage` -- percentage of `travelDistance` that will always produce maximum value change. This
defines a vertical region in the center of the view. Mouse/touch events outside of this region will have increased 
sensitivity as the event X is further from the view center X, requiring more movement for the same change in value.
* `trackLineWidth` -- the line width of the knob's arc that is drawn from the current value to the end.
* `trackColor` -- the color of the arc that is drawn from the current value to the end.
* `progressLineWidth` -- the line width of the knob's arc that is drawn from the start to the current value.
* `progressColor` -- the color of the arc thta is drawn from the start to the current value.
* `indicatorLineWidth` -- the line width of the knob's indicator that is draw from the current value towards the 
knob center.
* `indicatorColor` -- the color of the line that is drawn from the current value to the center.
* `indicatorLineLength` -- the amount of the line that is drawn from the current value to the center, where 0.0 
indicates no line will be drawn, and 0.5 results in a line that is half-way to the knob center point.
* `startAngle` -- the starting point in radians of the arc (see below)
* `endAngle` -- the ending point in radians of the arc
* `tickCount` -- number of ticks to show
* `tickLineLength` -- fraction of a radius to draw (0.0 - 1.0)
* `tickLineWidth` -- width of the tick line
* `tickColor` -- the color of the tick line
* `valueLabel` -- an optional UILabel/NSText to use to show a formatted textual representation of the current value.
* `valueName` -- optional name to show in the `valueLabel` when the knob is not being manipulated. If `nil`, the knob 
value is always shown.
* `valueFormatter` -- optional NumberFormatter to use to generate the textual representation shown in the `valueLabel`.
* `valuePersistence` -- the number of seconds to persist the last value shown before showing the `valueName` 
(if non-nil). Only applies after the end of a mouse or touch event.

Arc angles are explained well in the 
[UIBezierPath documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibezierpath/1624358-init). In brief, an 
angle of 0 will extend along the X axis, whereas an angle of Ï€/2 will extend along the negative Y axis.

![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/741002b545/radians_circle_4de280d3-557c-4d69-8f12-efed200dbbd3.jpg)

The `draw` method used to render the knob's arc path draws in a clockwise fashion, so the end arc angle must be greater 
than the start arc angle. The default values leave the opening in the arc path centered around the negative Y axis 
(pointing down), with an arc distance of 2/16 of the circumference.

## Mouse/Touch Tracking

As one would expect, a touch in the knob's view area is tracked and any changes are reported to any registered actions:

* Moving vertically up will increase the knob's value
* Moving vertically down will decrease the knob's value
* Moving horizontally does not affect the value but it does alter the `touchSensitivity` value that is used to generate 
updates to the control's `value`, and the further away a touch moves horizontally from the center, the more sensitive 
the vertical movements become -- one must move larger vertical distances to achieve the same value change.

# SwiftUI Support

The package also includes a SwiftUI implementation: `KnobView`. The defaults should be good enough to start with, but 
there are modifiers you can apply to your KnobView to configure the look you want. The `KnobView` constructor requires
two state bindings, one for the knob's value and another for the knob's manipulating flag. Additionally, you can provide
the `minimumValue` and `maximumValue` values to override the defaults of 0.0 and 1.0 respectively.

```
KnobView(value: $volumeValue, manipulating: $volumeManipulating, minimum: 0.0, maximum: 1.0)
  .trackStyle(width: trackWidth, color: trackColor)
  .progressStyle(width: progressWidth, color: progressColor)
  .indicatorStyle(width: progressWidth, color: progressColor, length: 0.3)
```

# Demo Apps

The `KnobDemo` folder contains an Xcode project which you can open to build simple demo apps for macOS and iOS 
platforms. These also contain UI tests that make sure that the knobs properly track and report out their values.

The demo apps use SwiftUI for their view definitions. They both contain a `ContentView` properly wires up two `KnobView`
instances with a `Text` view that shows the value of a KnobView.
